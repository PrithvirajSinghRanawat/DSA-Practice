# PROGRAM TO CONVERT FRACTION INTO RECURRING DECIMAL.

*Given two integers a and b(b != 0), the task is to return the fraction a/b in string format. If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.*

Examples: 

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: "0.5"
Explanation: 1/2 = 0.5 with no repeating part.

Input: a = 50, b = 22
Output: "2.(27)"
Explanation: 50/22 = 2.27272727... Since fractional part (27) is repeating, it is enclosed in parentheses.
