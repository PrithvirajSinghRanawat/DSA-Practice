# PROGRAM TO FIND THE VALUE OF BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT C(n, k).

*Given an integer values n and k, the task is to find the value of Binomial Coefficient C(n, k).*

**A binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be defined as the coefficient of x^k in the expansion of (1 + x)^n.**
**A binomial coefficient C(n, k) also gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be chosen from among n objects more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of a n-element set.**

Examples :

```
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The value of 4C2 is (4 × 3) / (2 × 1) = 6.

Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: The value of 5C2 is (5 × 4) / (2 × 1) = 10.

Input: n = 6, k = 3
Output: 20
Explanation: The value of 6C3 is (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 20.
