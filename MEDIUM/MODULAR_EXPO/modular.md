# PROGRAM TO FIND THE MODULAR EXPONENTIATION (POWER IN MODULAR ARITHMETIC).

*Given three integers x, n, and M, compute (x<sup>n</sup>) % M (remainder when x raised to the power n is divided by M).*

Examples : 

```
Input:  x = 3, n = 2, M = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: 3^2 % 4 = 9 % 4 = 1.

Input:  x = 2, n = 6, M = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: 2^6 % 10 = 64 % 10 = 4.
