# PROGRAM TO CALCULATE VALUE OF <sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub>.

*Given two numbers, n and r, the task is to compute nPr, which represents the number of ways to arrange r elements from a set of n elements. It is calculated using the formula n!/(n−r)!, where "!" denotes the factorial operation.*

**nPr = n! / (n - r)!**

Examples:

```
Input: n = 5
           r = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 5P2 = 5! / (5 - 2)!  = 20

Input: n = 6
           r = 3
Output: 120
Explanation: 6P3 = 6! / (6 - 3)!  = 120
