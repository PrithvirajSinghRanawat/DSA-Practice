# PROGRAM TO FIND WEEK DAY FOR A GIVEN DATE.

*Given a date (day, month, year), the task is to determine the day of the week on which that date falls. The function should be able to compute the day for any date in the past or future. The function should return values from 0 to 6 where 0 means Sunday, 1 Monday and so on.*

Examples:

```
Input: d = 30, m = 8, y = 2010
Output: 1
Explanation: 30th August 2010 was a Monday.

Input: d = 15, m = 6, y = 1995
