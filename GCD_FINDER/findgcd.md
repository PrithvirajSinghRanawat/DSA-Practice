# PROGRAM TO FIND GCD (GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR) OR HCF (HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR) OF TWO NUMBERS.

*Given two positive integers a and b, the task is to find the GCD of the two numbers.*

**Note: The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them.**

Examples:

```
Input: a = 20, b = 28
Output: 4
Explanation: The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20. The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28. Among these factors, 1, 2 and 4 are the common factors of both 20 and 28. The greatest among the common factors is 4.

Input: a = 60, b = 36
Output: 12
Explanation: GCD of  60 and 36 is 12.
