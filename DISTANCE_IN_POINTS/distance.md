# PROGRAM TO CALCULATE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS ON A PLANE.

*You are given two coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of a two-dimensional graph. Find the distance between them.*

Examples: 

```
Input : x1, y1 = (3, 4)
        x2, y2 = (7, 7)
Output : 5

Input : x1, y1 = (3, 4) 
        x2, y2 = (4, 3)
Output : 1.41421
